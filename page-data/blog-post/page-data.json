(literally, it did almost catch fire but that’s another story). You look across the room, your eyes meet those of your best mate, and the spark, oh boy, the spark is just palpable. You hug each other while your missus gently hands over glasses of water and you just softly whisper those magic words: “We should launch a digital business”.</p><p>This is kind of how it happened, truth is we just wanted to build better digital solutions and we wanted it to do it together. So we combined our collective expertise with consulting, finance and technology and took a leap of faith.

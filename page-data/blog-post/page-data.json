You don’t have to do it exactly how I did, but here’s what helped me.</p><p><strong>Step 1) I know you must have seen this piece of advice quite a lot but… Read + make notes from the Scrum Guide (a short pdf document which provides all the information necessary to pass). Along with this, attempt the scrum.org open assessment multiple times.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 2) Use the Mlapshin online practice questions — this is an excellent question simulator and will help you to solidify your knowledge in Scrum.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3) Use the Volkerdon exam simulator (it cost me $15 to purchase, but it was worth the investment for me as I wanted to make sure I don’t retake the PSM1 exam which is $150). This has 300+ practice questions (with tricky ones!) and makes sure you fully understand Scrum practices. The only downfall for this simulator was the fact that it had grammatical errors.</strong></p><p>I advise you to repeat these steps until you reach 90%+ on all practice tests which will prepare you to sit the real exam.

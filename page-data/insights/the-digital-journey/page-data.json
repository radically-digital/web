A well-executed DRA may find that a given area of your business lags behind others in terms of digital maturity. Or alternatively, it can find that whilst your company on-the-whole is digitally mature, a new incoming technology, such as Blockchain or AI, becoming standard in your industry or sector means you're under pressure to adopt and adapt, to avoid falling behind.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In such circumstances, a DRA will provide you and your management teams with the insights, metrics and guidance you need to take the next steps.

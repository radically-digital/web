You don’t have to do it exactly how I did, but here’s what helped me.</p><h2>Read the official Scrum.org Guide</h2><p>I know you must have seen this piece of advice quite a lot but read and make notes from the Scrum Guide (a short pdf document which provides all the information necessary to pass).</p><p>Along with this, attempt the <a  href=\"https://scrum.org\">scrum.org</a> open assessment multiple times.</p><h2>Practice Questions</h2><p>Use the <a  href=\"https://mlapshin.com/index.php/scrum-quizzes/\">Mlapshin online practice questions</a> — this is an excellent question simulator and will help you to solidify your knowledge in Scrum.</p><h2>Exam Simulator</h2><p>Use the <a  href=\"https://www.volkerdon.com/courses/psm1\">Volkerdon exam simulator</a> (it cost me $15 to purchase, but it was worth the investment for me as I wanted to make sure I don’t retake the PSM1 exam which is $150). This has 300+ practice questions (with tricky ones!) and makes sure you fully understand Scrum practices. The only downfall to this simulator was that it had quite a few grammatical errors.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I advise you to repeat these steps until you reach 90%+ on all practice tests which will prepare you to sit the real exam.</p><p>If you need further guidance/advice, you can contact me on <a  href=\"mailto:nikhil.hindocha@radically.digital\">nikhil.hindocha@radically.digital</a></p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"how-to-pass-your-psm1-exam-in-3-easy-steps"}}}

              Radically Digital was born from a search for a new way to solve

        <p>
          Have you ever had one of those beautiful summer evenings when the
          weather is just perfect and the bbq is on fire? (literally, it did
          almost catch fire but that’s another story). You look across the room,
          your eyes meet those of your best mate, and the spark, oh boy, the
          spark is just palpable. You hug each other while your missus gently
          hands over glasses of water and you just softly whisper those magic
          words: “We should launch a digital business”.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is kind of how it happened, truth is we just wanted to build
          better digital solutions and we wanted it to do it together. So we
          combined our collective expertise with consulting, finance and
          technology and took a leap of faith. Flash forward to the future, we
          are now a Deloitte meets Google, young consultancy which believes in
          creating practical digital solutions for their customers; and still
          meet for a bbq and a pint or two on a regular basis.

            Described as Deloitte meets Google, Radically Digital reimagines the
            very idea of consulting in the modern age.{" "}
